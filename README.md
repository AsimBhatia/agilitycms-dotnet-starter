### Tailwind CSS

This starter uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a simple and lightweight utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

It also comes equipped with [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer), a plugin which use the data based on current browser popularity and property support to apply CSS prefixes for you.

## Getting Started

ðŸš¨ Before you dive into the code, it's important that you have the latest version of the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine (>=v5.0), as the project will _not_ run without this.

### Generating/Syncing Content Models from your Agility Instance

1. cd into the `Agility.NET.AgilityCLI` directory.
2. Rename the `App.config.example` file to `App.config`.
3. Overwrite the values in the `App.config` file with the values from the API Keys page in [Agility Settings](https://manager.agilitycms.com/settings/apikeys).
4. Run `dotnet run update preview` to download the Content Models from your Agility CMS instance, and generate the classes of the Content Models for you.

### Setting up the Starter

1. cd into the `Agility.NET.Starter` directory.
2. Rename the `appsetting.json.example` file to `appsettings.json`.
3. Overwrite the values in the `appsettings.json` file with the credentials from the API Keys page in [Agility Settings](https://manager.agilitycms.com/settings/apikeys).
